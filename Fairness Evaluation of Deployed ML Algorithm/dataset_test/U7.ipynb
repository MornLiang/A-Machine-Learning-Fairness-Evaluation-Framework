The prediction task is to determine whether a patient survived or is deceased at a time of about 9 days after collecting their medical record at the hospital.\\n\\nThis is an important prediction problem in clinical medicine. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition triggered by an immune overreaction to infection, leading to organ failure or even death. Sepsis is associated with immediate death risk, often killing patients within one hour. This renders many laboratory tests and hospital analyses impractical for timely diagnosis and treatment. Being able to predict the survival of patients within minutes with as few and easy-to-retrieve medical features as possible is very important.', 'area': 'Health and Medicine', 'tasks': ['Classification'], 'characteristics': ['Multivariate'], 'num_instances': 110341, 'num_features': 3, 'feature_types': ['Integer'], 'demographics': ['Age', 'Gender'], 'target_col': ['hospital_outcome_1alive_0dead'], 'index_col': None, 'has_missing_values': 'no', 'missing_values_symbol': None, 'year_of_dataset_creation': 2020, 'last_updated': 'Fri Nov 03 2023', 'dataset_doi': '10.24432/C53C8N', 'creators': ['Davide Chicco', 'Giuseppe Jurman'], 'intro_paper': {'ID': 223, 'type': 'NATIVE', 'title': 'Survival prediction of patients with sepsis from age, sex, and septic episode number alone', 'authors': 'D.
